# Realtime AI Bicep ðŸ’ª counter 

A biceps curl counter based on human pose estimation. The idea is to make the user aware of inaccurate range of motion in real-time so that he/she can correct it immediately without the need of a human exercising partner. Often as a novice, we are dealing with incorrect exercising postures which eventually leads to no gain or in the worst conditions, unwanted damage and tear to the muscles.
